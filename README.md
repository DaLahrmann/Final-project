# Different ways of solving sudokus

In this project a comparison of different approaches of solving sudokus has been made. At first a recursive backtracking algorithm were used. Second an explit solving algorithm with logical tricks derived by human aproaches has been implemented. At last different Neural-Network models were implemented.
Used sudokus for train the models are downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/bryanpark/sudoku. Harder puzzles were be accessed by webscrape the website https://1sudoku.com/.
